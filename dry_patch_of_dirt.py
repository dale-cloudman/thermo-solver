This is to simulate a dry 1m x 1m patch of dirt

The goal is to get an accurate measure of the mean solar insolation and
mean radiated heat loss to space.

It is to see if we account for the dirt having depth and a heat capacity,
conduction applying downward, and handling convection upwards from the surface,
considering effect of gravity compressing the air etc., that this accounts
for the higher thermal radiation to space.

Radiative effects of atmosphere will be ignored at first to see what
results.
